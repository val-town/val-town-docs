Val Town is a collaborative website to create and scale Javascript functions. Create APIs, crons, store data – all from the browser, and deployed in miliseconds.

##### What is a val?

- Vals are hosted JavaScript functions
- Vals run on the Val Town serverless platform
- Vals can import other vals, NPM, and more [↗](/reference/import)
- Vals can be public, unlisted, or private [↗](/reference/permissions)
- Vals are run via the Deno runtime [↗](/reference/runtime)
- Vals support JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX

There are **4 types of vals**, each with different _triggers_:
