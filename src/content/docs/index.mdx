Val Town is a website to write and deploy apps. Create APIs, websites, scheduled functions, email yourself,
and persist data — all from the browser and instantly deployed.

- Vals are runnable JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX modules
- Vals can import other vals, NPM, and more [↗](/reference/import)
- Vals can be public, unlisted, or private [↗](/reference/permissions)
- Vals are run via the Deno runtime

There are 4 types of vals, each with different triggers:

- [**Script**](/types/script) - freeform, run manually, for one-offs or testing
- [**HTTP**](/types/http) - make a website, API endpoint, accept webhooks
- [**Cron**](/types/cron) - trigger code on a timer
- [**Email**](/types/email) - trigger code on an incoming email

**The Val Town Standard Library** provides a some free hosted services:

- [**SQLite**](/std/sqlite) - store and retrieve structured data
- [**Blob Storage**](/std/blob) - store and retrieve any data
- [**OpenAI**](/std/openai) - use the OpenAI API
- [**Email**](/std/email) - send emails
- [**Proxied Fetch**](/std/proxied-fetch) - make requests from anonymous IP addresses

If you're new to Val Town or programming, we recommend starting with [Townie](/townie), our AI assistant that can write vals for you, or one of our quickstarts: [website](/quickstarts/first-website), [cron](/quickstarts/first-cron).

You can also use Val Town programmatically using the [Val Town SDK](/sdk).
