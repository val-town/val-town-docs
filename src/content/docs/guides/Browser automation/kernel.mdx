description: How to use Kernel with Val Town
---

import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

[Kernel](https://onkernel.com/) is a serverless browser automation platform.
It runs full Chrome instances in the cloud and provides a simple WebSocket/HTTP API.

Because Val Town can’t launch a local browser, Kernel lets you use tools like **Puppeteer** or **Playwright** by connecting to a remote browser session hosted on Kernel’s infrastructure.

### Quick start with Puppeteer

1. Remix this [Kernel starter val](https://www.val.town/x/onkernel/kernel_starter)
2. Create a free [Kernel account](https://onkernel.com/) and generate an API key from **Settings → API Keys**
3. Add it to your val’s Environment Variables (left sidebar) as `KERNEL_API_KEY`
4. Click **Run** on `puppeteer.ts`
5. View logs for output

### Quick start with Playwright

Kernel also supports Playwright sessions.

Steps are nearly identical:

1. Remix this [Kernel starter val](https://www.val.town/x/onkernel/kernel_starter)
2. Add your `KERNEL_API_KEY` to Environment Variables
3. Set `TMPDIR` to `/tmp` to avoid Playwright file-system warnings
4. Click **Run** on `playwright.ts`
5. Check the logs for output
