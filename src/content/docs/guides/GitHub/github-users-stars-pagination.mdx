When there are many results, GitHub
[paginates](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-pagination)
the data. You can use the `per_page` parameter to loop over the data. Here's a
practical example: getting the total stars across a user's repositories.

Here's a Val that returns the star count for a username.

```ts title="@vtdocs/getGithubStars" val
import { fetchJSON } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/fetchJSON?v=41";

export const getGithubStars = async (username: string) => {
  const user = await fetchJSON(
    `https://api.github.com/users/${username}`,
  );
  let totalStars = 0;
  // Paginate the max number of pages per request
  let pages = Math.ceil(user.public_repos / 100);
  while (pages--) {
    for (
      const repo of await fetchJSON(
        `https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos?per_page=100&page=${
          pages + 1
        }`,
      )
    ) {
      totalStars += repo.stargazers_count;
    }
  }
  return totalStars;
};
```

Call it to get the result:

```ts title="Usage of @vtdocs/getGithubStars" val
import { getGithubStars } from "https://esm.town/v/vtdocs/getGithubStars";

console.log(await getGithubStars("stevekrouse"));
```

## Email yourself when you get a comment reaction!

Create a GitHub personal access token:
[https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
Give it permissions to the repositories that you're interested in getting
comment reaction notifications for.

Allow _Read-only_ access for issues to find your recent issue comments (pull
requests are issues).

![Untitled](./github-users-stars-pagination/untitled.png)

Go to:
[https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables)
and save the token as `githubPatToken`.

Run this Val, change `username` to your GitHub username, and schedule it to run
every **fifteen minutes**.

```ts title="Every 15 minutes" val
import { email } from "https://esm.town/v/std/email?v=9";
import { msMinute } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/msMinute?v=1";
import { msAgo } from "https://esm.town/v/rodrigotello/msAgo?v=2";
import { githubPatToken } from "https://esm.town/v/vtdocs/githubPatToken";
import { fetchJSON } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/fetchJSON?v=41";

export const emailGithubReactions = async () => {
  const username = "stevekrouse";
  const events = await fetchJSON(
    `https://api.github.com/users/${username}/events?per_page=100`,
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${githubPatToken}`,
      },
    },
  );
  const comments = events.filter((event) =>
    event.type === "IssueCommentEvent" && event.payload.action === "created"
  );
  const recentReactions = [];
  for (const comment of comments) {
    for (
      const reaction of await fetchJSON(
        comment.payload.comment.reactions.url,
      )
    ) {
      if (msAgo(15 * msMinute)) {
        recentReactions.push(
          `${reaction.user.login} reacted with ${reaction.content} to ${comment.payload.comment.html_url}`,
        );
      }
    }
  }
  if (recentReactions.length > 0) {
    await email({
      text: recentReactions.join("\n"),
      subject: "new github reactions!",
    });
  }
};
```

When this Val runs, it gets the last 100 events for an authenticated user. It
makes additional requests to get the reactions for any recent events that are
comments.

If the reaction was created in the last fifteen minutes, then it's a new
comment!

You'll receive a batch of reactions and comment links only for new reactions.
