  Using the third-party service ntfy.sh, you can send push notifications to phones and computer with Val Town.

import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

While we have tentative plans to create `console.push` that would be as easy to
use as `console.email` and might work via
[Web Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API), in
the meantime we recommend [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) as an easy way to send
yourself push notifications to your phone.

## [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh)

1. Download the app
2. Create an account
3. Add your channel to your
   [Val Town Environment Variables](https://val.town/settings/environment-variables)
4. Use `@axelav.sendNotification` to send yourself a message

## Pushover

For iOS, [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) is another great way to get push
notifications.
