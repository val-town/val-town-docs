## Introduction

By the end of this tutorial you will have a Discord bot hosted 24/7, for free,
forever, on [Val Town](https://val.town), that responds to a basic `/ping`
[Slash Command](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ).

[Val Town](https://val.town) is a social website to write, and deploy JavaScript
from the browser.

No prior coding experience required. The vast majority of this tutorial is
creating the bot on Discord and pasting your keys into Val Town. The actual
coding parts are just clicking **Run** two times to remix two pieces
of code to your Val Town account.

1. **Copy** your Application ID
2. Go to [val.town/settings/environment-variables](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables)

1. **Copy** and paste it in
   [val.town/settings/environment-variables](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables) as
   `discordBotToken`.

## Step 5: Register a new Slash Command

1. The embedded code below should have your name in the top-left corner. If you
   see **anonymous**, refresh this page. If you
   still see **anonymous**, ensure
   [you're logged into Val Town](https://www.val.town/auth/signin).
2. Press **Run** to add the `/ping` command to your bot.

```ts title="Register /ping command" val
import { registerDiscordSlashCommand } from "https://esm.town/v/neverstew/registerDiscordSlashCommand";

const result = await registerDiscordSlashCommand(
  Deno.env.get("discordAppId"),
  Deno.env.get("discordBotToken"),
  {
    name: "ping",
    description: "Say hi to your bot",
  },
);
export const registerDiscordCommand = result.json();
```

## Step 6: Listen for Slash Commands

1. Press **Run** to listen for Slash Commands and reply.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/maxm/discordBotExample" />

2. Next to your val's name, click ðŸ”’ > **Unlisted.**
3. In the val above, in the bottom-left corner of the val, click **Script** and change it to **HTTP.**
4. Click on the URL at the bottom of that val that looks like
   [https://username-handleDiscordInteraction.web.val.run](https://stevekrouse-handlediscordinteraction.web.val.run/)
5. Visit the General Information page for your bot and paste your copied
   endpoint into **INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL** and click **Save
   Changes**.

## Further Directions

Now that you have a basic Discord Bot setup, you'll want to customize it to do
exactly what you want. You'll probably want to:

1. Register a new Slash Command
2. Connect your bot to APIs like OpenAI's GPT or Dall-E
