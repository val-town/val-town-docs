import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

You can create a Discord welcome bot using scheduled vals.

In this example, a scheduled val gets the most recent members for your server
and sends a DM to new users from a bot that you'll create. It avoids messaging
users who joined the server before the bot was added.

When users reply to the bot, the message is forwarded as a DM.

## Create a new Discord application

Visit
[https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

![create-an-app.png](./create-a-discord-welcome-bot/create-an-app.png)

## Enable the server members intent

Since the bot will be requesting a list of guild members, you need to enable the
**SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** on the **Bot** tab.

## Get your bot's token

On the **Bot** tab, copy the **TOKEN**, and save it as a [Val Town environment variable](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables) as
`discordBot`.

## Create a link via the URL Generator

On the **OAuth2** tab, under **URL Generator,** select the **bot** scope, and
give it permission to **Send Messages**, and then copy the **GENERATED URL** at
the bottom of the page.

Choose the server you want to invite the bot to and press **Continue**.

## Get your Server ID

Save your server id as a [Val Town environment variable](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables) as `discordServerId`. (See:
[Where can I find my User/Server/Message ID?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-))

## Setup your welcome message scheduled val

Remix this scheduled val that will send a welcome message to new users.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/vtdocs/discordWelcomeBotCron" />

This val stores state in three other vals.

- `@me.discordWelcomeBotStartedAt` stores the timestamp of the bot's creation so
  that everyone who's already on the server doesn't get a welcome message when
  the bot is added.
- `@me.discordWelcomedMembers` stores the ids of everyone that has been messaged
  so that they don't receive another message.
- `@me.discordDMs` stores the channel ids (each time the bot DMs a user it
  creates a channel) so that we can check for replies to the bot.

These vals will be automatically created if they don't already exist.

## Get your User ID

Save your user id as a [Val Town environment variable](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables) as `discordUserId`. (See:
[Where can I find my User/Server/Message ID?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-))

This is so the bot knows where to forward user replies.

## Set up your message forwarder scheduled val

Remix this scheduled val that will forward user replies to your Discord user.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/vtdocs/discordWelcomeBotMsgForwarder" />

This val loops through all of the DMs between the bot and new users. It checks
for any new replies and then forwards these messages as a new DM (from the bot,
to your Discord user).
