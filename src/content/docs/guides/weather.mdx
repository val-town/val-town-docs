## wttr.in

Val Town is a great system for keeping track of the weather - 
for remembering [when to carry an umbrella](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/umbrellaReminder)
and much more. Here's an example of using [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) to get weather
data.

## Weather data sources

There are many sources for weather data, but some of them require
payment and API keys. If you need something free and you're primarily
interested in weather in the United States, you can check out
the [NOAA weather API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).
Also, [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/price) provides a decent
number of calls per day for free.

wttr.in also uses [WorldWeatherOnline](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/weather-api/api/docs/local-city-town-weather-api.aspx) as its source
for forecasts and current conditions.
