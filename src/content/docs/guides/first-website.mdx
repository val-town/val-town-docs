This is a guide to making a website on Val Town using React JSX, such as a link-in-bio page or a personal website.

#### Step 1: Sign up to Val Town

[Sign up to Val Town](https://www.val.town/auth/signup). It's free.

#### Step 2: Remix this template

The quickest way to get started in Val Town is to remix someone else's val. Remixing a val creates a copy of the val in your own account, which you can then edit.

1. Go to https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/linkInBioTemplate
2. Click on the **Remix** button in the top right corner.

##### Source Code

<Val
  url="https://www.val.town/embed/x/valdottown/linkInBioTemplate/main.tsx"
  height="400px"
/>

##### Output

<iframe
  src="https://docs-linkinbiotemplate.val.run/"
  width="100%"
  frameborder="0"
  style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px; height: 300px;"
></iframe>

#### Step 3: Customize it!

1. Edit your name in `<title> </title>` in `h1`
2. Edit your self-description line
3. Customize your links
4. Customize the styles
5. Highlight a block of text and ask AI to rewrite it to suit your needs
6. Ask [Townie](https://www.val.town/townie), our AI coding assistant, to help you with any of the above
