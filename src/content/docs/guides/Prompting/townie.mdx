[Townie](https://val.town/townie) is Val Town's coding agent that can read, edit, and run your vals alongside you in the Val Town editor.

Powered by the Claude 4.5 family and our [MCP server](/guides/prompting/mcp). Available on Val Town Pro and Teams plans. Click the little robot in the bottom right corner on [val.town](https://val.town) to get started.

## Features

### Models

We're using the latest Anthropic models in the [Claude 4.5 family](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview).

1. **Opus 4.5**
2. **Sonnet 4.5 (default)**
3. **Haiku 4.5**

### Modes

1. **Normal**: Townie asks you to approve before writes
2. **Plan**: Townie as your read-only thinking partner
3. **Allow all edits**: Townie YOLOs changes to your vals

### Tools

Townie has full access to our [MCP server](/guides/prompting/mcp), so it can do almost anything you as a user can do.

- List, search, & create vals
- Read, write, & run files
- View history, create & switch branches, revert versions
- Query your SQLite databases & Blob storage
- Read & write environment variables
- Read logs
- Read & configure cron jobs

### System prompt

Our [system prompt](https://val.town/townie/system-prompt) is public. It provides Townie full context on how to use the Val Town platform—e.g. available [tools](#tools), the Val Town [runtime](/reference/runtime/), our standard library, different types of vals, etc.

### Keyboard shortcuts & slash commands

You can open Townie with `⌘J`. The following slash commands are available:

- `/cost` Show estimated cost and usage
- `/context` Show context window usage
- `/compact` Summarize older messages to save context
- `/clear` Start a new chat

### History & version control

You can view your Townie [chat history in settings](https://www.val.town/settings/chat-history) to read and continue old chats.

As when coding without AI, you can use Val Town's [versioning and collaboration](https://docs.val.town/vals/#versioning--collaboration) tools like branching, remixing, PRs, and version history to safely work with Townie.

## Pricing

Townie is available on Val Town [Teams](https://www.val.town/teams) and [Pro](https://www.val.town/pricing) plans with $100 and $5 monthly usage included, respectively.

| 🟩 Teams    | 🟨 Pro    | 🟥 Free       |

## Prompting guide

_Last updated January 28th, 2026._

- **Sonnet versus Haiku versus Opus**: Haiku is surprisingly good (better than state of the art a year ago), super fast, and quite cheap. Sonnet is a good default, better than Haiku for coding and complex agent work, but 3x more expensive than Haiku and a bit slower. Opus is best for planning complex stuff, but it's slower and 5x more expensive than Haiku. .
- **Normal versus Plan versus YOLO**: Normal mode is the default, good for adding on a discrete feature or fixing a single bug. In Normal mode Townie will research then ask you to approve code changes. Plan mode is good for larger changes, like starting a new project or thinking through a tricky bug, when you don't want code suggestions just yet. Allow all edits (aka YOLO mode) is best reserved for low stakes work where you "fully give in to the vibes" and "forget that the code even exists." Use YOLO mode for stuff like prototypes or internal dashboards that don't need to look perfect—anything you don't need to maintain or simple enough to redo from scratch.
- **Branching**: Townie can create and switch branches so that you can approve changes safely without accidentally breaking prod (`main` branch on your val).
- **Debugging**: Townie can see what file you have open in the val editor, so you can treat Townie as your co-worker over your shoulder pair programming with you. Townie can also read your val's logs, which is enormously helpful when trying to troubleshoot bugs and test fixes.
- **Compaction**: when you run out of context, you can run `/compact` to have Townie summarize the chat to buy more context window. But compaction can be problematic. Try to keep convos short and to-the-point, and start new chat for discrete tasks. Just like you wouldn't want to code with 1000 open tabs, models don't like coding with lots in their context window. Run `/context` to check how much of the window you've used.
