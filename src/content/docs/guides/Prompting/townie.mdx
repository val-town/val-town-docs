[Townie](https://val.town/townie) is Val Town's coding agent that can read, edit, and run your vals alongside you in the Val Town editor.

Powered by the Claude 4.5 family and our [MCP server](/guides/prompting/mcp). Available on Val Town Pro and Teams plans. Click the little robot in the bottom right corner on [val.town](https://val.town) to get started.

## Features

### Models

We're using the latest Anthropic models in the [Claude 4.5 family](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview).

1. **Opus 4.5**
2. **Sonnet 4.5 (default)**
3. **Haiku 4.5**

### Modes

1. **Normal**: Townie asks you to approve before writes
2. **Plan**: Townie as your read-only thinking partner
3. **Allow all edits**: Townie YOLOs changes to your vals

### Tools

Townie has full access to our [MCP server](/guides/prompting/mcp), so it can do almost anything you as a user can do.

- List, search, & create vals
- Read, write, & run files
- View history, create & switch branches, revert versions
- Query your SQLite databases & Blob storage
- Read & write environment variables
- Read logs
- Read & configure cron jobs

### System prompt

Our [system prompt](https://val.town/townie/system-prompt) is public. It provides Townie full context on how to use the Val Town platform—e.g. available [tools](#tools), the Val Town [runtime](/reference/runtime/), our standard library, different types of vals, etc.

### Keyboard shortcuts & slash commands

You can open Townie with `⌘J`. The following slash commands are available:

- `/cost` Show estimated cost and usage
- `/context` Show context window usage
- `/compact` Summarize older messages to save context
- `/clear` Start a new chat

### History & version control

You can view your Townie [chat history in settings](https://www.val.town/settings/chat-history) to read and continue old chats.

As when coding without AI, you can use Val Town's [versioning and collaboration](https://docs.val.town/vals/#versioning--collaboration) tools like branching, remixing, PRs, and version history to safely work with Townie.
