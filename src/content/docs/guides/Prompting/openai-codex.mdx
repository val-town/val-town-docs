description: Bring Val Town to OpenAI Codex with the vt CLI
---

## Instructions

1. Install the [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt) and log in
2. Install [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and log in
3. Copy-paste our [system prompt](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt) into `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` at the root of your local val directory

## Creating and editing vals

The most reliable way to let Codex write vals for you is with `vt watch`, which will automatically sync your changes to Val Town.

1. `vt create`, `vt remix`, or `vt clone` a val
2. `cd` into your val's directory
3. `vt checkout -b <branch>` to isolate changes (optional)
4. `vt watch` to sync with Val Town
5. `codex` to start your Codex session
