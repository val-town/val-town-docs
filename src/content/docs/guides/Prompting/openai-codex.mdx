description: Bring Val Town to OpenAI Codex with the vt CLI or MCP
---

Work with Val Town in Codex using our [CLI](#cli) or [MCP](#mcp) server. You can ask Codex to:

- List or examine your vals and read your sqlite data, logs, and almost any of your Val Town data
- Edit your vals and even agentically iterate, viewing the output and logs until it's done

## CLI

1. Install [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and log in
2. Install the [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt) and log in

```
deno install -grAf jsr:@valtown/vt
```

3. `vt create`, `vt remix`, or `vt clone` a val. Select "Yes" to add editor files\*
4. `cd` into your val's directory
5. `vt checkout -b <branch>` to isolate changes (optional)
6. `vt watch` to sync with Val Town
7. `codex` to start your Codex session

_\* Running `vt create|remix|clone` will prompt you to add editor files, including `AGENTS.md` with our [system prompt](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt), which Codex should recognize._

## MCP

1. Install [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and log in
2. [Connect Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/#connect-codex-to-an-mcp-server) to the Val Town MCP server

```
codex mcp add val-town --url https://api.val.town/v3/mcp
```

3. Set up a [Val Town API token](https://www.val.town/settings/api/new) in `~/.codex/config.toml` and export it (or persist in `~/.zshrc` or equivalent)

```toml
[mcp_servers.val-town]
url = "https://api.val.town/v3/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "VAL_TOWN_API_TOKEN"
```

```sh
export VAL_TOWN_TOKEN="vtwn_..."
```

4. Run `codex`
