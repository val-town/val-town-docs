Use the `vt` CLI to work with Val Town in your favorite IDE, e.g. with [Cursor](/guides/prompting/cursor).

`vt` is built with the Deno TypeScript runtime. To use vt, you need to make sure you [have Deno installed](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/).

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Install the [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt): `deno install -grAf jsr:@valtown/vt`

2. Run `vt` to login to Val Town

3. `vt create`, `vt remix`, or `vt clone` a val. Select “Yes” to add editor files\*

4. `cd` into your val's directory

5. (Optional) `vt checkout -b <branch>` to isolate changes

6. `vt watch` to sync your changes to Val Town as you save files

</Steps>

_\* This will include `AGENTS.md`, which LLMs should respect (with some exceptions, like `CLAUDE.md`)._

## Tips, Troubleshooting

- Ask to list or examine your vals or read sqlite data, logs, etc.
- Ask your LLM to edit vals and even agentically iterate
- Broken code? Visit the `Versions` tab or `History` of your val to revert
- Large changes? Use feature [branches](/vals/branches) and [merge](/vals/pull-requests) when stable
- Need help? Ask in the [Val Town Discord](https://discord.val.town/) in the `#local-dev` channel

:::caution
As always, review your LLM's code for risks like prompt injection. The more permissions you grant your LLM, the more it can do with your Val Town data (SQLite, blob storage, etc.).
