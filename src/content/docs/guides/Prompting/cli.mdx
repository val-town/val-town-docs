Use the Val Town CLI to work with Val Town in your favorite IDE, e.g. with [Cursor](/guides/prompting/cursor).

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Install the [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt): `deno install -grAf jsr:@valtown/vt`

2. `vt create`, `vt remix`, or `vt clone` a val. Select “Yes” to add editor files\*

3. `cd` into your val's directory

4. (Optional) `vt checkout -b <branch>` to isolate changes

5. `vt watch` to sync your changes to Val Town as you save files

</Steps>

_\* This will include `AGENTS.md`, which LLMs should respect (with some exceptions, like `CLAUDE.md`)._

:::caution
As always, review your LLM's code for risks like prompt injection. The more permissions you grant your LLM, the more it can do with your Val Town data (SQLite, blob storage, etc.).
