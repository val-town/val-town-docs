Use the Val Town MCP server to work with Val Town in your preferred AI tool, e.g. with [Claude Code](/guides/prompting/claude-code#mcp).

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Connect the Val Town MCP server to your LLM

2. Authenticate to Val Town MCP by following the OAuth flow

</Steps>

```
# E.g. for Claude Code
> claude mcp add --transport http val-town https://api.val.town/v3/mcp
> /mcp
```

:::caution
As always, review your LLM's code for risks like prompt injection. The more permissions you grant your LLM, the more it can do with your Val Town data (SQLite, blob storage, etc.).
