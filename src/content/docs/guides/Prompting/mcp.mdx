Use the Val Town MCP server to work with Val Town in your preferred AI tool, e.g. with [Claude Code](/guides/prompting/claude-code#mcp).

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Connect the Val Town MCP server (`https://api.val.town/v3/mcp`) to your LLM

2. Authorize the Val Town MCP server by following the OAuth flow

</Steps>

E.g. for Claude Code:

```
claude mcp add --transport http val-town https://api.val.town/v3/mcp
```

In Claude, type `/mcp` to confirm that it's connected, and authenticate if necessary.

:::note
Are we missing your favorite LLM? Click "Edit page" to update these docs, or [ask](https://discord.val.town/) [us](mailto:docs-help@val.town) to help.
:::

## Tips, Troubleshooting

- Ask your LLM to list or examine your vals or read sqlite data, logs, etc.
- Ask your LLM to edit vals and even agentically iterate
- Broken code? Visit the `Versions` tab or `History` of your val to revert
- Large changes? Use feature [branches](/vals/branches) and [merge](/vals/pull-requests) when stable
- Need help? Ask in the [Val Town Discord](https://discord.val.town/) in the `#local-dev` channel

:::caution
As always, review your LLM's code for risks like prompt injection. The more permissions you grant your LLM, the more it can do with your Val Town data (SQLite, blob storage, etc.).
