You can work with Val Town in ChatGPT (Web, Desktop) using our [MCP](#mcp) server.

## MCP

1. Open ChatGPT
2. Enable [developer mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode) in Settings → Apps & Connectors → Advanced → Developer mode
3. Go to Settings → Apps & Connectors and add the Val Town MCP server
4. In a chat, choose Developer mode from the Plus menu and select the Val Town MCP server

Per ChatGPT's developer mode documentation, you can approve tool use within a conversation but not globally, so you'll need to authorize Val Town MCP for each chat.

:::note
ChatGPT's full MCP support is [only available](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-full-mcp-connectors-in-chatgpt-beta) for Business, Enterprise and Education accounts as of this writing.
