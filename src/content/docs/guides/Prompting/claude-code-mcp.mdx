## Setup

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)
2. Install the Val Town MCP:

```
claude mcp add --transport http val-town https://api.val.town/v3/mcp
```

3. Start `claude`
4. Run `/mcp` to view available MCP servers
5. Select `val-town`
6. Authenticate to Val Town by following the OAuth flow

## Tips

- You can ask Claude to list or examine your vals, read your sqlite data, logs, and almost any of your Val Town data
- You can ask Claude to edit your vals, and even agentically iterate, viewing the output, and logs, until it's done
- If you're feeling lucky, you can run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
