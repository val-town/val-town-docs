description: Bring Val Town to Claude Code with the vt CLI or MCP
---

Work with Val Town in Claude Code using our [MCP](#mcp) server or [CLI](#cli). You can ask Claude to:

- List or examine your vals and read your sqlite data, logs, and almost any of your Val Town data
- Edit your vals and even agentically iterate, viewing the output and logs until it's done

## MCP

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)
2. Install the Val Town MCP server:

```
claude mcp add --transport http val-town https://api.val.town/v3/mcp
```

3. Start `claude`
4. Run `/mcp` to view available MCP servers
5. Select `val-town`
6. Authenticate to Val Town by following the OAuth flow

:::tip
If you're feeling lucky, you can run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
:::

:::tip
Use the [Playwright MCP server](https://til.simonwillison.net/claude-code/playwright-mcp-claude-code) to allow Claude Code to act as an agent, coding for you in a loop.

## CLI

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)
2. Install the [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt)

```
deno install -grAf jsr:@valtown/vt
```

3. Copy-paste our [system prompt](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt) into [`CLAUDE.md`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory) at the root of your local directory for vals
4. `vt create`, `vt remix`, or `vt clone` a val\*
5. `cd` into your val's directory
6. (Optional) `vt checkout -b <branch>` to isolate changes
7. `vt watch` to sync with Val Town
8. `claude` to start your Claude Coding session

_\* Running `vt create|remix|clone` will ask you to add editor files including `AGENTS.md`, which Claude doesn't support as of this writing (use `CLAUDE.md` instead)._

As an example, watch this 4-minute video [creating a customer support val](https://screen.studio/share/pYSiLKJU).
