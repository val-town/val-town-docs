description: Bring Val Town to Claude Code with the vt CLI
---

Sync Claude Code edits to Val Town using the `vt` CLI.

## Setup

1. Install the [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt) and log in
2. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart) and log in
3. Copy-paste our [system prompt](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt) into [`CLAUDE.md`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory) at the root of your local directory for vals

## Creating and editing vals

The most reliable way to let Claude write vals for you is with `vt watch`, which will automatically sync your changes to Val Town.

1. `vt create`, `vt remix`, or `vt clone` a val
2. `cd` into your val's directory
3. `vt checkout -b <branch>` to isolate changes (optional)
4. `vt watch` to sync with Val Town
5. `claude` to start your Claude Coding session

# Example

We recorded a video [creating a customer support val](https://screen.studio/share/pYSiLKJU) in 4 minutes with `vt` and Claude code.
