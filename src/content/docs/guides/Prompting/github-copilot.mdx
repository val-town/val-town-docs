## Instructions

1. Install the [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt) and log in
2. Open [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
3. Copy-paste our [system prompt](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt) into [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot)

## Creating and editing vals

The most reliable way to write vals in VS Code with GitHub Copilot is with `vt watch`, which will automatically sync your changes to Val Town as you save files.

1. `vt create`, `vt remix`, or `vt clone` a val
2. `cd` into your val's directory
3. `vt checkout -b <branch>` to isolate changes (optional)
4. `vt watch` to sync with Val Town
