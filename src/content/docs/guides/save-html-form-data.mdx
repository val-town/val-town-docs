import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

You can submit forms to Val Town using the [HTTP val](/types/http). You can
place these forms on any page on the internet - or host the form directly on Val
Town.

These examples show how to accept and store email addresses on Val Town. The
email addresses are saved into a val, and you also get sent an email
notification for each new signup.

## Add a form to your website

### Create an [HTTP val](/types/http)

Write a val function that accepts a
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/request) and returns
a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/response).

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/maxm/saveFormDataExample?v=1" />

### Add the form to your webpage

Copy your val's Web endpoint URL using the menu (Endpoints > Copy web endpoint)
and set it as the form's action (this tells the form where to send its data when
it's submitted).

Below is a full HTML page example. If you are adding a form to an existing page
just copy and paste the `<form></form>` block.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Email Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Change the action here to your val's Express endpoint! -->
    <form action="https://user-saveFormData.web.val.run" method="post">
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
      <br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Host your form on Val Town

There are two ways to do this. You can write a val function that serves a
webpage, and a separate val that accepts the form data - or you can write a
single val that does both like the example below.

When a form is submitted, it sends a HTTP request with the
[POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) method.
When a user visits a webpage in their web browser, the server (your val
function) gets sent a
[GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) request.

You can check the HTTP method using `req.method` and change how your val
function responds.

See [Web forms — Working with user data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms)
on the MDN Web Docs site for more help with forms. Forms are a basic part of
the web - you don't need a lot of front-end JavaScript to make them work.
