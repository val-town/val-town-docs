This is a guide to creating a cron job that sends you a weather email every morning.

### Step 1: Sign up to Val Town

[Sign up to Val Town](https://www.val.town/auth/signup). It's free.

:::note
The email you sign up with will be the one that receives the weather emails.
:::

### Step 2: Set up a Cron Trigger

Create a new val. In a new file, set the trigger type to **Cron**.

This will create a scheduled trigger associated with this file. The default code will look like this:

```ts title="weatherNotifier.ts"
export default async function (interval: Interval) {
  // your codeâ€¦
}
```

This function will be run on a schedule. By default, this runs every hour. You can change the frequency by clicking on the Cron in the top right corner of the file.

### Step 3: Get the weather

In the following example code, we are using `getWeather` from [stevekrouse/getWeather](https://val.town/v/stevekrouse/getWeather). It uses the free [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/:help) service to get weather data.

1. Add these lines to your code

```ts title="Step 3" ins={1,4-5}
import { getWeather } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/getWeather";

export default async function (interval: Interval) {
  let weather = await getWeather("Brooklyn, NY");
  console.log(weather.current_condition[0].FeelsLikeF);
}
```

2. Replace `Brooklyn, NY` with your location
3. Click **Run**
4. View the output in the val's logs

:::tip
You'll notice that we're importing code from another val into this file. This is a common pattern in Val Town. Learn more about [importing here](/reference/import/).
:::

### Step 4: Send yourself an email

We're going to use [std/email](https://val.town/v/std/email) to send an email to yourself.

1. Add these lines to your code

```ts title="Step 4" ins={1,7-10}
import { email } from "https://esm.town/v/std/email";
import { getWeather } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/getWeather";

export default async function (interval: Interval) {
  let weather = await getWeather("Brooklyn, NY");
  let feelsLike = weather.current_condition[0].FeelsLikeF;
  let description = weather.current_condition[0].weatherDesc[0].value;
  await email({
    subject: `Weather now is ${description} and ${feelsLike}Â°F`,
  });
}
```

2. Click **Run**
3. Check your email inbox

You should have an email with a subject like "Weather now is Sunny and 67Â°F".

### Step 5: Schedule the Job

We want this to run every morning. For example, in NYC, you could use `0 9 * * *` to run at 5am ET every morning.

We recommend [crongpt.com](https://crongpt.com) to help you write cron expressions. It also handles the timezone conversion from your timezone to Val Town's server timezone (UTC).

1. Go to [crongpt.com](https://crongpt.com) and generate your cron expression
2. Click the clock icon (or find the schedule settings) in the file editor for your `weatherNotifier.ts` file.
3. Click **Cron**
4. Paste in your cron expression.
