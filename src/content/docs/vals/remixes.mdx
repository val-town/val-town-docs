Remixes are a way to create a copy of a val in your account while maintaining references to the original. They can be used for cross-account collaboration. Changes in a remix can be merged back via [pull requests](../pull-requests).

### Remixing

Remixing creates a copy of a val in your account while maintaining references to the original. This process includes the `main` branch even when a non-main branch is remixed to maintain consistency.

### Merging

A remix can only be merged into its parent if there are no conflicts. All edits are copied to the parent val, and the version is updated to match the latest version in the parent.
