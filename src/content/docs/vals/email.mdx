Email vals get their own email address that you can send email to. When Val Town
receives that email, it triggers the val with the email as its first argument.

Some common examples include:
- Automatically forwarding emails
- Posting support team emails to Discord / Slack

:::tip
Vals can send email, too! Using the [email function in the standard library](/std/email)
:::

## Type Signature

Email vals receive an argument called `Email` that represents the email that was sent to the val. Here's an example of an email val:

```ts title="Example"
export async function emailValHandler(email: Email) {
  console.log("Email received!", email.from, email.subject, email.text);
  for (const file of email.attachments) {
    console.log(`Filename: ${file.name}`)
    console.log(`Content Type: ${file.type}`)
    console.log(`Content: ${await file.text()}`)
  };
}
```

The `Email` type has this shape:

```ts
interface Email {
  from: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string | undefined;
  text: string | undefined;
  html: string | undefined;
  attachments: File[];
}
```

## Example

This val forwards any email it receives to me. Try it out by sending an email to `stevekrouse.forwarder@valtown.email`.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/stevekrouse/forwarder" />

## Limitations

:::note[Email size limit]

The total size of inbound emails, including attachments, must be less than 30MB.
