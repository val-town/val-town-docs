Pull Requests are used to merge changes from a branch or remix back into the parent. They are a way to propose changes to a val, and they are the primary way to collaborate on vals with other users.

To make a PR, create a remix of the parent val, then visit the parent val's **Pull requests** page where you will see an "Open pull request" button. If you're the owner of the parent val, you can also create a PR from a branch of that val.
