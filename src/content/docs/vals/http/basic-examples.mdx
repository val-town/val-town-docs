import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

HTTP vals, unlike other vals, expose a public endpoint.

An HTTP val that works with the Web API takes a Request object as input and returns a Response object.

The most basic example can ignore the request and just return a response, even using a shorthand method like [Response.json, which is part of the web standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json_static).

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/tmcw/jsonOkExample" height="160px"/>

A slightly more built-out val can return HTML along with the correct Content-Type header:

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/tmcw/htmlExample" height="230px"/>

Now let's work with the request: this echoes request headers back in the response:

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/tmcw/headersExample" height="180px"/>

We can grab query parameters using the web standard [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/searchParams) class:

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/neverstew/queryParams" height="180px"/>

You can also get the body of POST requests using the Request object,
for example if you had an endpoint that received JSON:

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/tmcw/jsonBodyParsing" />

To obtain the HTTP endpoint for your HTTP val, use the "Copy HTTP endpoint" feature (located in the val's sidebar, or in its ... menu).
