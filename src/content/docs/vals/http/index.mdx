HTTP triggers let you serve a scalable API or website.

They are built on the web-standard
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects,
so are compatible with a number of web frameworks like
[Hono](https://hono.dev/).
