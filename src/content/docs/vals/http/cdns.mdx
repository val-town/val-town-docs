description: How to use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and cache control headers with HTTP vals
---

When your HTTP val becomes popular or needs to serve visitors around the world quickly, you may want to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and serve your content.

**CDNs** are a network of servers that cache your content in multiple locations around the world, allowing users to access it from the nearest server, reducing latency and improving load times. Popular CDNs include [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

For example, [the Val Town Blog](https://blog.val.town) is [hosted on Val Town](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/blog), but served through Cloudflare's CDN.

### Cloudflare CDN

1. Set up your [Val Town Custom Domain](/vals/http/custom-domains) via Cloudflare's DNS management
2. Ensure that proxying (the orange cloud) is enabled.
3. Ensure the CDN configuration for that domain enables caching
4. Add a Cache Rule to enable caching for all content on that endpoint, respecting the cache control headers set by your val. This is important because the default setting is to not cache anything.
5. Add `Cache-Control` headers in your val ([learn more](#cache-control-headers))
6. Debug your CDN configuration by checking the response headers your browser's devtools or via curl. If you see `cf-cache-status: HIT`, then your CDN is working correctly. If you see `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`, then the CDN doesn't think the content is cacheable and you may need to adjust your Cloudflare Cache Rule.

### Fastly CDN

We confirmed that Fastly works with Val Town custom domains, but we don't have a step-by-step guide yet. If you want to help us write one, please reach out!

### Cache Control Headers

Cache control headers are HTTP headers that specify how and for how long a resource should be cached by browsers and CDNs.

#### Basic cache control headers

```ts
export default (req: Request) => {
  return new Response("Hello, world!", {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=3600", // Cache for 1 hour
    },
  });
};
```

#### Hono

```ts
import { cache } from "hono/cache";
import { Hono } from "hono";
const app = new Hono();

app.get(
  "*",
  cache({
    cacheName: "my-app",
    cacheControl: "public, max-age=300", // cache for 5 minutes
    wait: true,
  })
);

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.html("Hello, world!");
});
```

### Disabling caching during development

It can be very fustrating if you forget that caching is enabled while you're actively developing your val. You may not see your changes immediately, or you may see stale content.

The simplest way is to disable caching in your browser. For example, in Chrome, you can open DevTools (F12), go to the Network tab, and check "Disable cache" while DevTools is open.

We also recommend disabling all caching for `*.val.run` domains, so that you can test your changes without ever worrying about caching. This way caching will only be enabled for custom domains.

For example:

```ts
export default (req: Request) => {
  const url = new URL(req.url);
  return new Response("Hello, world!", {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": url.hostname.endsWith(".val.run")
        ? ""
        : "public, max-age=3600",
    },
  });
};
```

Or in Hono:

```ts
app.get("*", async (c, next) => {
  const url = new URL(c.req.url);
  if (url.hostname.endsWith(".val.run")) {
    return next();
  }
  return cache({
    cacheName: "my-app",
    cacheControl: "public, max-age=300",
    wait: true,
  })(c, next);
});
```
