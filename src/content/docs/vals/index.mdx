Vals are the building blocks of Val Town. They can be used to create APIs, crons, websites, and email handlers with JavaScript.

A val is a collaborative, versioned folder of deployed code—kind of like a GitHub repo where the code can run. It includes everything you need to run code in the cloud, including:

- [HTTP](/vals/http), [Cron](/vals/cron), and [Email](/vals/email) triggers
- [Environment variables](/reference/environment-variables/)
- [Import](/reference/import/) from other NPM, JSR, and more
- [Access controls](/reference/permissions/)
- Version control & collaboration: reversions, [branching](/vals/branches), [remixes](/vals/remixes), [pull requests](/vals/pull-requests)
- The Deno [runtime](/reference/runtime/)
- [SQLite](/reference/std/sqlite) and [blob](/reference/std/blob) storage
- Logs & traces

#### Triggers

There are **3 types of triggers** that JavaScript files within a val can have:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="HTTP"
    description="Triggered by https requests. You can make APIs or websites"
    href="/vals/http"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Cron"
    description="Triggered by a timer or cron expression"
    href="/vals/cron"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Email"
    description="Triggered by an incoming email"
    href="/vals/email"
  />
</CardGrid>

#### Versioning & Collaboration

Every file change is automatically versioned. Rollbacks are instantaneous. You can create branches and remixes for development and collaborating.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Branches"
    description="Create branches for feature development, testing, and sharing"
    href="/vals/branches"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Remixes"
    description="Remix another user's val to make changes and send a pull request"
    href="/vals/remixes"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Pull Requests"
    description="Merge changes from a branch or remix back into the parent val"
    href="/vals/pull-requests"
  />
</CardGrid>
