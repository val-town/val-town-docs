description: How to use TestingBot to scrape websites with Val Town
---

Some websites are partially (or entirely) rendered on the client (aka your web
browser). If you try to search the initial HTML for elements that haven't
finished rendering, you won't find them.

One solution is to use a headless browser that runs a web browser in the
background that fetches the page, renders it, and _then_ allows you to search
the final document.

[TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/)
provides an API to interact with a remote headless browser. You can use a Function to [scrape a website](https://testingbot.com/support/functions/scrape) and fetch its contents. 

## Sign up to TestingBot and retrieve your credentials

Copy the API key and SECRET from the 
[TestingBot dashboard](https://testingbot.com/members/user/security)
and save it as Val Town environment variables `testingbot_key` and `testingbot_secret`.

## Make an API call to the [/scrape API](https://testingbot.com/support/functions/scrape)

Check the documentation for the
[/scrape API](https://testingbot.com/support/functions/scrape) and prepare your request.

For example, here's how you scrape the introduction paragraph of OpenAI's
Wikipedia page.

```ts title="Scrape API example" val
import { fetchJSON } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/fetchJSON?v=41";

export default async function ScrapeWebsite(url: String, selector: String) {
  const res = await fetchJSON(
    `https://cloud.testingbot.com/scrape?key=${Deno.env.get("testingbot_key")}&secret=${
      Deno.env.get("testingbot_secret")
    }&browserName=chrome&version=latest&platform=WIN10`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        url: url,
        elements: [
          {
            // The second <p> element on the page
            selector: selector,
          },
        ],
      }),
    },
  );
  // For this request, TestingBot will return one data item
  const data = res[0];
  // That contains a single element
  const elements = data.results;
  // Which we want to turn into its innerText value
  const intro = elements[0].text;
  return intro;
}
console.log("Scrape result:", await ScrapeWebsite("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "p:nth-of-type(2)"));
```

There are other functions available, such as [taking screenshots](https://testingbot.com/support/functions/screenshot), [generating PDFs](https://testingbot.com/support/functions/pdf) and more.

## Use Puppeteer to instrument a remote browser

You can use the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) library to connect to a remote browser running on TestingBot.

Once you've navigated to a URL, you can run arbitrary JavaScript with
`page.evaluate` - like getting the text from a paragraph.

```ts title="Puppeteer example" val
import { PuppeteerDeno } from "https://deno.land/x/puppeteer@16.2.0/src/deno/Puppeteer.ts";

const puppeteer = new PuppeteerDeno({
  productName: "chrome",
});
const capabilities = {
    'tb:options': {
        key: Deno.env.get("testingbot_key"),
        secret: Deno.env.get("testingbot_secret")
    },
    browserName: 'chrome',
    browserVersion: 'latest'
};
const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
  browserWSEndpoint: `wss://cloud.testingbot.com/puppeteer?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(capabilities))}`,
});
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI");
const intro = await page.evaluate(
  `document.querySelector('p:nth-of-type(2)').innerText`
);
await browser.close();
console.log(intro);
```
