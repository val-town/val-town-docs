[Steel](https://steel.dev/) is an open-source browser API that lets you control fleets of browsers in the cloud.

## Quick start

The quickest way to get started is to get your Steel API key and fork this val.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/stevekrouse/steel_puppeteer_starter" />

1. Get your free Steel API key at https://app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys
2. Add it to your [Val Town Environment Variables](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables) as `STEEL_API_KEY`
3. Fork [this val](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/steel_puppeteer_starter)
4. Click `Run` on that val
5. View the output in the logs

:::note
To use Puppeteer in Val Town, we reccomend using the
[deno-puppeteer](https://deno.land/x/puppeteer@16.2.0) library – as is done in the above starter val.
