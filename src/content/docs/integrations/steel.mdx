import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

[Steel](https://steel.dev/) is an open-source browser API that lets you control fleets of browsers in the cloud. 

Since Val Town can't run browsers locally, Steel provides a way to run browser automation tools like Puppeteer and Playwright by connecting to remote browsers hosted on Steel's infrastructure.

## Quick start with Puppeteer

The quickest way to get started with Puppeteer is to get your Steel API key and remix this val.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/steel/steel_puppeteer_starter" />

1. Remix this [Steel Puppeteer val](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/steel_puppeteer_starter)
2. Get your free [Steel API key](https://app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys)
3. Add it to your Environment Variables (via left sidebar of your val) as `STEEL_API_KEY`
4. Click `Run` on the `main.tsx` file
5. View the output in the logs

:::note
To use Puppeteer in Val Town, we recommend using the
[deno-puppeteer](https://deno.land/x/puppeteer@16.2.0) library – as is done in the above starter val.

## Quick start with Playwright

You can also use Playwright with Steel on Val Town.

Similar to the setup instructions above:
1. Remix this [Steel Playwright val](https://www.val.town/x/wolf/PlaywrightDemo)
2. Get your free [Steel API key](https://app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys)
3. Add it to your Environment Variables (via left sidebar of your val) as `STEEL_API_KEY`
4. Set `TMPDIR` to `/tmp` in your Environment Variables to avoid warnings
5. Click `Run` on the `main.ts` file
6. View the output in the logs

:::note
We use [a small script](https://www.val.town/x/wolf/StubFS/branch/main/code/stubFs.ts) to handle Playwright's file system requirements in Val Town.

Also, each Steel API key supports only one active browser session. Starting a new session will close any existing session.
