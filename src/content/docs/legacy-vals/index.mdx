description: Information about the old single-file val system.

:::danger[Deprecated]
The concept of single-file "Legacy Vals" and separate "Projects" has been replaced by a unified **Val** primitive â€“ a collaborative folder for deployed code.

All legacy vals have been automatically upgraded. Read our [blog post](https://blog.val.town/upgrading) for migration details.

Please refer to the main [Vals documentation](/vals/) for current information.
