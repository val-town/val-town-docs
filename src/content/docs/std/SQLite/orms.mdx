Writing SQL is really fast and it’s great for small projects. As your projects
grow, you might want to take advantage of an ORM or query builder instead. Here
are a few examples of how to do that with popular tools.

## Drizzle

```ts
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite";
import { sql } from "npm:drizzle-orm";
import { drizzle } from "npm:drizzle-orm/libsql";
import { integer, sqliteTable, text } from "npm:drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

const db = drizzle(sqlite as any);
const kv = sqliteTable("kv", {
  key: text("key").primaryKey(),
  value: text("value").notNull(),
});
const sqliteDrizzleExample = await db.select().from(kv).all();
console.log(sqliteDrizzleExample);
```

## Prisma

🚫 Prisma isn’t supported in Val Town because it relies on functionality that
only exists in a classic server environment.

## Sequelize

🚫 Sequelize isn’t supported in Val Town because it relies on specific database
drivers and is not extensible.
