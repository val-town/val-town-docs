title: ORMs

Writing SQL is really fast and it's great for small projects. As your projects
grow, you might want to take advantage of an ORM or query builder instead. Here
are a few examples of how to do that with popular tools.

## Drizzle

```ts title="Example" val
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite";
import { sql } from "npm:drizzle-orm";
import { drizzle } from "npm:drizzle-orm/libsql";
import { integer, sqliteTable, text } from "npm:drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

const db = drizzle(sqlite as any);
const kv = sqliteTable("kv", {
  key: text("key").primaryKey(),
  value: text("value").notNull(),
});
const sqliteDrizzleExample = await db.select().from(kv).all();
console.log(sqliteDrizzleExample);
```

## Prisma

🚫 Prisma isn't supported in Val Town because it relies on functionality that
only exists in a classic server environment.

## Sequelize

🚫 Sequelize isn't supported in Val Town because it relies on specific database
drivers and is not extensible.
