title: Blob Storage
lastUpdated: 2024-05-09

Val Town comes with blob storage built-in. It allows for storing any data: text, JSON, images. You can access it via [`std/blob`](https://www.val.town/v/std/blob).

Blob storage is scoped globally to your account. If you set a blob in one val, you can retrieve it by the same key in another val. It's backed by Cloudflare R2.

You may find [this admin viewer](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/blob_admin) helpful for viewing and editing your blobs.

##### Get JSON

```ts title="Get JSON"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

let blobDemo = await blob.getJSON("myKey");
console.log(blobDemo); // returns `undefined` if not found
```

##### Set JSON

```ts title="Set JSON"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.setJSON("myKey", { hello: "world" });
```

##### List keys

```ts title="List Keys"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

let allKeys = await blob.list();
console.log(allKeys);

const appKeys = await blob.list("app_");
console.log(appKeys); // all keys that begin with `app_`
```

##### Delete by key

```ts title="Delete"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.delete("myKey");
```

### Error Handling

- `blob.get` can throw [`ValTownBlobNotFoundError`](https://val.town/v/std/ValTownBlobNotFoundError)
- Any method can throw [`ValTownBlobError`](https://val.town/v/andreterron/ValTownBlobError) for unexpected errors.

### Utilities

Our Blob SDK also includes some utility functions to make working with blobs easier.

##### Copy

```ts title="Copy"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.copy("myKey", "myKeyCopy");
```

##### Move

```ts title="Move"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.move("myKey", "myKeyNew");
```

### Lower-level API

We do provide access to the lower-level getter and setters, which are useful if you are storing non-JSON or binary data, need to stream in your response or request data, or do anything else lower-level.

- `async get(key: string)`: Retrieves a blob for a given key.
- `async set(key: string, value: string | BodyInit)`: Sets the blob value for a given key. See [BodyInit](https://deno.land/api@v1.38.1?s=BodyInit).

### Limitations

- Blob-stored data counts towards your total Val Town storage – 10mb on the free plan and 1gb on pro. Check our [pricing page](https://val.town/pricing) to learn more.
- Keys for blobs can be up to 512 characters long.
