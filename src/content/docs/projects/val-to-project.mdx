[Val Town Projects](https://blog.val.town/blog/projects/) help you organize code and collaborate more effectively. This guide walks you through migrating single-file vals into a Project.

:::note
Looking to **start** a new project? Remix one of our [**Templates**](https://www.val.town/explore/use-cases#:~:text=Hacker%20News%20mentions-,Project%20Starters,-Projects%20are%20groups) instead.
:::

## 1. Create a New Project
Go to the [Val Town Dashboard](https://www.val.town/dashboard) and create a **New Project**.

## 2. Copy Vals to Project
This is where the bulk of migration happens and likely the most annoying step ðŸ˜”. Luckily, everything else past this point is optional.

First, copy and paste each val you want to migrate into the Project, with the correct val type.

After all the vals are now saved in a new project, update the old vals to redirect users.
  - **Option 1: Add a note in `README.md`** 

    `This val has moved to https://www.val.town/x/username/project-name`

  - **Option 2: Redirect the val**

    ```js
    export default async function(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
      const url = new URL(req.url);
      return fetch(new URL(url.pathname + url.search, "https://your_project_name--your_project_id.web.val.run/"), {
        method: req.method,
        headers: req.headers,
        body: req.body,
      });
    }
    ```

Then, you need to replace absolute imports with relative imports to ensure your vals continue to work across branches and remixes.

  **Before:**
  ```js
  // Absolute imports
  import { myVal } from "https://esm.town/v/username/myVal"
  ```

  **After:**
  ```js
  // Relative imports
  import { myVal } from "./myVal.ts"
  ```

## 3. Handle Binary Assets
**For images and other binary files:**
- Remix this [Blob Admin Tool](https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/blob_admin/code/README.md)
- Sign in with with the email tied to your Val Town account
- Upload your files to the Public folder and get the URL
- Use the returned URL in your code

[**Example usage**](https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/stevekrouse_dot_com/code/posts/proposal.tsx), search (ctrl/cmd+f) for usage of `blob_admin`.

## Optional Steps
Once you have completed all the steps above, your vals should now be working in the new Project. However, here are additional steps you may find helpful to make your Project even more organized.

### 1. Rename Vals
1. Remove prefixes that match your project name, as all your vals are now inside the same project.
    - Example: `myblog_homepage` â†’ `homepage`  
2. Rename the main HTTP endpoint to `index` (this becomes the entry point). This one is mostly just a convention.

### 2. Separate Frontend and Backend
Single-file vals have traditionally needed to include both client-side and server-side code in the same file. As your projects grow. this is difficult to manage and disjointed long files are also very difficult to use with LLMs.

There are many ways to structure a Project. Here's one example:
```
my-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ database/
```

By separating the frontend and backend, we largely eliminate the need for conditional or async import patterns common in single-file vals.

To do this, you can:
- Store `/frontend` and `/backend` logic in separate directories.
- You can use a `/public` directory for serving static assets ([Example](https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/reactHonoExample/code/backend/index.ts)) - though this is mostly just a [convention](https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/reactHonoExample/code/frontend/README.md).

Here is an [**example project**](https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/reactHonoExample) set up with the frontend and backend in separate folders.

### 3. Move Static Content to Files
Once you separate out your frontend and backend, it will make sense to move static content (HTML, CSS, JSON, etc.) out accordingly.

#### **HTML Example**

Replace inline HTML strings with a `index.html` file:

**Before:**
```js
  return new Response(`
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Hello, world!</title>
        <style>${css}</style>
      </head>
    </html>,
  `),
```

**After:**
```js
// 1. Create a file at `/frontend/index.html`
// 2. Serve your files with:
import { serveFile } from "https://esm.town/v/std/utils@74-main/index.ts"; // [pin the latest version](https://docs.val.town/reference/version-control/#:~:text=If%20you%20include%20a%20version%20number%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20pinned%20import%2C%20and%20you%E2%80%99ll%20always%20get%20that%20version.) for stability, make sure you test it!

// Example using Hono  
app.get("/", async c => {
  return serveFile("/frontend/index.html", import.meta.url);
});

```
[**Example usage**](https://www.val.town/x/std/reactHonoStarter/code/backend/index.ts)


#### **CSS Example**

Replace CSS-in-JS with a `styles.css` file:

**Before:**
```js
const css = `
    body {
    color: red;
    }
`;
```

**After:**
```js
// 1. Create a file at `/frontend/styles.css`
// 2. Reference in your HTML with <link> tag
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/public/style.css">
```
