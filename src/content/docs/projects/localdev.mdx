Val Town has an official command line tool for editing your val town projects locally, `vt`.

`vt` is much like git. With `vt`, you can clone a Val Town project, edit the project locally, and then push to Val Town. `vt` also has a watch command, which lets you sync a folder on your computer live with Val Town, so you can use your favorite local tools to edit the project, and automatically have changes propogate to the website.

For more information on `vt`, check out the [`vt` JSR page](https://jsr.io/@valtown/vt).
