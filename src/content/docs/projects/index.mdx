Projects are groups of related vals, files, and folders that are versioned together. They are used to manage large codebases, organize related files, and collaborate with others.

Learn more about [why we created Val Town Projects in our announcement post](http://blog.val.town/blog/projects/).

## Project features

- **Versioned Workspace:** Projects contain and track changes to vals, files, folders, READMEs via an version number that goes up on any change to any file
- **Multiple Entrypoints:** Add multiple [HTTP](../vals/http), [Cron](../vals/cron), [Email](../vals/email), and [Script](../vals/script) vals
- **Relative Imports:** Import files and folders relative to the project root (ie. `import foo from '../bar/foo'`)
- **Static Files:** Add static files (HTML, CSS, Markdown, etc) to projects
- **Scoped [Environment Variables](../reference/environment-variables)**
