There are three privacy settings for a Val:

### Public
- Discoverable and visible to everyone on the Val.town website
- Anyone can view the code and import it into their own vals
- HTTP endpoints are accessible to anyone

### Unlisted
- Only visible to people who have the direct link
- Won't appear in search results or public listings
- Anyone with the link can view the code and import it
- HTTP endpoints are accessible to anyone who knows the URL

### Private
- Only visible to you
- Only your vals can import the code
- HTTP endpoints are accessible to anyone who knows the URL

## Exposing your vals to the internet

HTTP endpoints are accessible to anyone who knows the URL, regardless of the val's privacy setting. If your endpoint handles sensitive data, you should add authentication.

Since anyone can call your endpoints, if they interact with some data
that should only be changed by yourself, you will need to make sure that those
endpoints check for some kind of secret that only you know.

Here's an example of a val exposed using the [HTTP Val](/types/http), secured
with an environment variable that only I know:

```ts title="user/secretEndpoint" val
export const secretEndpoint = (req: Request) => {
  const secretHeader = req.headers.get("Authorization");

  if (secretHeader !== Deno.env.get("supersecrettoken")) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }

  return new Response("My deepest darkest secret");
};
```

If I called it without supplying the environment variable, I'd be denied access:

```ts title="Without authentication" val
import { fetch } from "https://esm.town/v/std/fetch";

const response = await fetch("https://user-secretEndpoint.web.val.run");
console.log(response);
```

```js title="Logs"
Response {
  body: ReadableStream { locked: false },
  bodyUsed: false,
  headers: Headers { /* omitted */ },
  ok: false,
  redirected: false,
  status: 401,
  statusText: "Unauthorized",
  url: "http://localhost:3001/v1/fetch?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuser-secretEndpoint.web.val.run"
}
```

By supplying the environment variable in a header, I'm allowed access:

```ts title="With authentication" val
import { fetch } from "https://esm.town/v/std/fetch";

const response = await fetch("https://user-secretEndpoint.web.val.run", {
  headers: { Authorization: "birdsarentreal" },
});
console.log(response);
```

```js title="Logs"
Response {
  body: ReadableStream { locked: false },
  bodyUsed: false,
  headers: Headers { /* omitted */ },
  ok: true,
  redirected: false,
  status: 200,
  statusText: "OK",
  url: "http://localhost:3001/v1/fetch?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuser-secretEndpoint.web.val.run"
}
```


## Public code referencing private data

It is safe for a a public val to reference one of your private vals or one of
your environment variables. Private vals are like environment variables in this
way â€” others can see that they're being used, but not their values.

For example, I created a private val, `example3`. You won't be able to see or
reference `example3` but I can use it in `example4` which is public.

```ts title="@user/example4"
import { example3 } from "https://esm.town/v/user/example3";
console.log("Hi,", example3);
```

```txt title="Logs"
Hi, User
```

You can _infer_ that the value of `example3` is `"User"` because of
how it's used here. This is why you have to be careful about publishing vals
that reference private data. Typically you will reference private data in a way
that makes it impossible for others to infer what it is, like you would with an
environment variable credentials. Below I am passing my environment variables to an Upstash
Redis store. You can see that I'm using these environment variables and the output of this
computation, but you can't get those values, nor can you rerun this script with
my environment variables.

```ts title="Example" val
import { Redis } from "npm:@upstash/redis";
const redis = new Redis({
  url: Deno.env.get("upstashURL"),
  token: Deno.env.get("upstashToken"),
});
await redis.set("json-ex-1", { a: { b: "nested json" } });
const get = await redis.get("json-ex-1");
console.log(get);
```

```ts title="Output"
nested json
```

## Using another's vals as a library

You can [import](/reference/import) any Public or Unlisted vals and use
them in your own code. In this way
it is safe to pass other's code your private data and environment variables.

```ts title="Example" val
import { gpt3 } from "https://esm.town/v/patrickjm/gpt3?v=4";

export let librarySecret = gpt3({
  prompt: "what is the meaning of life?",
  openAiKey: Deno.env.get("openai"),
});
```

:::danger[Import security]

If you're importing someone else's code, read the code first to make
sure it's trustworthy, and we recommend version-pinning any dependencies
against other people's code, like `?v=4` in the example above.

## Hiding Code

You can hide the code of a public API by wrapping a private Val in a public val.
Below I show `hiddenAPI` which you can see and
[call via API](https://api.val.town/v1/run/stevekrouse.hiddenAPI?args=[%22hi%22]),
but you notice that it calls `@stevekrouse.hiddenAPIInternal` which is private
and can't be inspected.

```ts title="Hiding code example" val
import { hiddenAPIInternal } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/hiddenAPIInternal";

export let hiddenAPI = (...args) => hiddenAPIInternal(...args);
```

## Custom Authentication

You can roll arbitrary authentication schemes in user space. For example, I find
it useful to simply supply a custom `auth` header from my Clerk webhooks that I
check like a password against a value I store in my environment variables:

```ts title="Clerk example" val
import { discordWebhook } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/discordWebhook";

// # New Val Town User (on Clerk) -> Val Town Discord notification
// Translates one kind of webhook (Clerk) into another (Discord)
export async function handleDiscordNewUser(req: express.Request, res) {
  // check custom auth secret sent from clerk
  if (req.get("auth") !== process.env.clerkNonSensitive)
    return res.end("Unauthorized");
  await discordWebhook({
    url: Deno.env.get("discordUserEvents"),
    content:
      req.body.data.email_addresses[0].email_address +
      " " +
      req.body.data.profile_image_url,
  });
  res.end("Success");
}
```

I call this value `clerkNonSensitive` because this value doesn't protect any
data. It merely makes it impossible for anyone to trigger this public API
endpoint without the password. The worst that could happen if this password
leaks is that our team temporarily gets spam discord messages. Then I could just
change the password to a new value. For more sensitive use-cases, you'll want to
sign & possibly encrypt the conveyed data using standard authentication methods.

## Legacy Private Vals

Prior to February 10th, 2024, private HTTP vals required an API token to access their endpoints. The endpoint was only accessible to the val owner and wasn't visible on the Val Town website.

This behavior was changed - HTTP endpoints are now accessible to anyone who knows the URL, regardless of privacy setting. Private vals created before this date have been given a `Legacy private` permission setting to preserve their original behavior.
