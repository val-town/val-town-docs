We rate limit a small number of crawlers/bots that we identify by their
`User-Agent` Header. These bots generated an inordinate amount of traffic
(they are particularly fond of [playing chess](https://maxm-staticchess.web.val.run/)).
We've placed a global rate limit on their request volume. They are collectively
allowed 500 reqests every 5 minutes.

This list may change at any time, we'll do our best to keep it up to date.
