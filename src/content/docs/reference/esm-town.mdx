description: Endpoint for getting val source code
---

esm.town is the home of source code hosted on Val Town. Every val has a corresponding esm.town URL â€“ simply replace `val.town` with `esm.town` in the URL to get the source code for that val. Vals import code from other vals using their esm.town URL.

For example, https://val.town/v/stevekrouse/demoSDK has its source code available at https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/demoSDK.

There are a few things to note about esm.town:

- This endpoint will always redirect to a specific version (`?v=15`)
  if a version isn't provided initially.
- We detect your client - whether it's a browser, Deno, or something
  else, and try to serve raw TypeScript source code when the client
  is able to parse it, and transpiled JavaScript when it can't.
  This includes [JSX syntax](/vals/http/jsx/).
  See [our guide on interoperability](/guides/interop/) for more
  information on using vals in other systems.
- Private vals are accessible on esm.town only by providing a
  [Bearer token](/reference/api/authentication).
