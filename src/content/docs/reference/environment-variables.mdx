import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

You can store secrets, keys, and API token in two places:
- [Global Environment Variables](https://val.town/settings/environment-variables): For single Vals, but **not accessible in Projects**.
- Project Environment Variables: Added through the Project's left side bar.

Environment variables can be accessed via `Deno.env` or `process.env`.

- The "key" and "value" of each environment variable can be any string
- Vals can't set environment variables: Environment variables are set via the settings page. Trying to update an environment variable, for example by using `Deno.env.set`, is a no-op.

### Deno.env

This uses the Deno-default
[Deno.env](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/env_variables) variable,
which is available globally.

```ts
const secret = Deno.env.get("someSdkSecret");
export let sdk = new SomeSDK(secret);
```

### process.env

This is the conventional way to access environment variables when you're in a
Node.js environment.

```ts
const secret = process.env.someSdkSecret;
export let sdk = new SomeSDK(secret);
```

## Environment variables are private in public vals

It is safe for a public val to reference your environment variables.
Others can see that they're being used, but not their values.

For example, in this public script val, you can see that I'm using a discord bot's environment variable, but you cannot run this code or get the value of the environment variable.

<Val

  height="180px"
/>

If you expose an HTTP or email val, those vals can be _triggered_ by anyone who knows their URL or email address, but they still can't access your environment variables. This is how server-side code normally works. If someone wants to run your code with _their_ environment variables, they need to _import_ your code and run it in their own vals.
