import { LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Val Town code runs on the [Deno](https://deno.com/) runtime.

- TypeScript and TSX are available for all vals, and at the time of this
  writing we support TypeScript 5.9.2.
- There is no filesystem access permitted - but you _can_ store file-like objects
  using [Blob storage](/reference/std/blob).
- `--allow-net` is enabled, so they can make HTTP requests.
- Vals have access to [environment variables](/reference/environment-variables).
- The experimental [Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) is
  enabled.

## Included environment

- `fetch` to make HTTP requests
- `import` from npm and https
