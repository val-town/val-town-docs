One of the best features of Val Town is the ability to import modules. There are thousands
of modules written in JavaScript and TypeScript that you can instantly
import to extend and supercharge your vals.

Val Town supports importing code from a variety of sources, including other vals on Val Town,
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [JSR](https://jsr.io), [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/), [deno.land](https://deno.land/x).
You can also import code from arbitrary URLs if they provide the correct `Content-Type` header
and contain JavaScript or TypeScript.
Imports in Val Town work the same as in Deno, so you can [learn more from their docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/modules/).

## Importing vals

Within vals, you can import files and folders relative to the val root (e.g., `./home`), which means you don't have to update your imports when you branch, remix, or rename a val.

Val source code hosted on [esm.town](/reference/esm-town),
and are available for import on Val Town, Deno, Node, the browser, and anywhere else https-imports are supported.
In this way, Val Town builds upon the new http-style imports, to make a lightweight package registry,
but where each snippet of code is a package.

Private vals are only importable with the `DENO_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable set, which we
automatically set for you, allowing only you to import your private vals.

## NPM

To import an npm module, like [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod), add
`npm:` in front of the name. So,

```ts
import { z } from "npm:zod";
```

:::note[NPM compatibility and the sandbox]

Most NPM modules are supported and will work great in Val Town. However,
we do run in a security sandbox: a val can't access the filesystem. Some
NPM modules try to do that, and won't be able to. Using esm.sh
is often an effective workaround for these modules. See
[permissions errors](/troubleshooting/permission-errors/) for more
information.

## JSR

Val Town supports importing [JSR](https://jsr.io) modules. Simply add `jsr:` and `@` in front of the module name:

```ts
import { concat } from "jsr:@std/bytes";
```

## HTTP Imports

To import from a URL, like from `esm.sh`, you just specify the full url. For
example, to import `zod` from `esm.sh`:

```ts
import { z } from "https://esm.sh/zod";
```

## Node builtins

If you want to import a Node.js built-in module, add `node:` in front of its
name. For example, to import the
[crypto](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v20.x/docs/api/crypto.html) module, use
this, which is the same as what Node.js themselves officially recommend:

```ts
import { createHmac } from "node:crypto";
```

## Debugging imports

### Look for examples

Whenever you go to use a new npm library, we recommend first searching to see if
anyone has used that library before.
[You can find the most common packages here](https://www.val.town/examples/packages).

Or you could look for examples related to `cheerio` by searching for it or even
more pointedly by searching for [`"npm:cheerio"`](https://www.val.town/search?q=%22npm:cheerio%22).

### Log keys

It's often not clear how a library will expose its methods. It can be helpful to
log the keys of whatever object they return to you. That will tell you if you
need to import it off of default or not, and what is available to you.

```ts title="Example" val
import * as cheerio from "npm:cheerio";

console.log(Object.keys(cheerio));
```

```txt title="Logs"
[
  'contains', 'default',
  'html',     'load',
  'merge',    'parseHTML',
  'root',     'text',
  'xml'
]
```

### Look for Deno compatibility

Not all modules are compatible with Deno.
Some modules are written with only Node.js or a browser environment in mind, and
won't work with Deno. While Deno implements most of the functionality of Node.js
and some of the functionality of browsers - so many modules will "just work" in
it, some won't.

Also, some modules are written with the assumption that they can access system
resources, compile C code, and more, so they won't work in a secure environment
like Val Town.
