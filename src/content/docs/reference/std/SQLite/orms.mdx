description: Using Object-Relational Mapping libraries with Val Town SQLite
---

Writing SQL is really fast and it's great for small projects. As your projects
grow, you might want to take advantage of an <abbr title="Object relational mapping">ORM</abbr> or query builder instead. Here
are a few examples of how to do that with popular tools.

## Drizzle

Here's how to use the awesome [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
module with Val Town and SQLite. It's great because it allows you to write
very expressive SQL. We even use Drizzle to build Val Town!

```ts title="Example" val
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite";
import { sql } from "npm:drizzle-orm";
import { drizzle } from "npm:drizzle-orm/libsql";
import { integer, sqliteTable, text } from "npm:drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

const db = drizzle(sqlite as any);
const kv = sqliteTable("kv", {
  key: text("key").primaryKey(),
  value: text("value").notNull(),
});
const sqliteDrizzleExample = await db.select().from(kv).all();
console.log(sqliteDrizzleExample);
```

## Prisma

ðŸš« Prisma isn't supported in Val Town because it relies on functionality that
only exists in a classic server environment.

## Sequelize

ðŸš« Sequelize isn't supported in Val Town because it relies on specific database
drivers and is not extensible.
