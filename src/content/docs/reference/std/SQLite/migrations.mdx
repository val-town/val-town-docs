description: How to manage database schema changes with migrations in Val Town SQLite
---

One way to run migrations for SQLite in Val Town is to write a single val and keep
updating it with each migration. The version history of that val can act as a log of schema changes.

Let's look at an example: In our first migration, we create a users table:

```ts title="Migration 1" val
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite";

await sqlite.execute(`
  create table users (
    id integer primary key autoincrement,
    email text not null unique
  )
`);
```

Later, we realize we also want to store names. We can update _the same val_ to alter
the table:

```ts title="Migration 2" val
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite";

await sqlite.execute(`
  alter table users
  add column name text
`);
```
