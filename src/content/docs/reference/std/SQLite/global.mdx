description: Account-scoped SQLite databases

Prior to “scoped” SQLite databases for each val, which landed in 2026, every Val Town user account has had its own global SQLite database (since 2023). In most cases, val-scoped databases make more sense, but account-scoped (global) databases will continue to work forever.

We typically refer to your user account database as either "account-scoped" or "global."

## Importing global sqlite

Either import statement below will import the account-scoped sqlite object.

```ts title="Global SQLite" val
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite/global.ts";
import { sqlite } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite"; // also works
```

## Querying global sqlite

Note that the `rows` array returned from global sqlite is an array of arrays, whereas the `rows` object returned by scoped sqlite is an array of objects.

```ts title="Querying" val
import { sqlite as global } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite/global.ts";
import { sqlite as scoped } from "https://esm.town/v/std/sqlite/main.ts";

// Returns an array of arrays
const { rows } = await global.execute("SELECT * FROM users;");

// Returns an array of objects
const { rows } = await scoped.execute("SELECT * FROM users;");
```

See [usage](/reference/std/sqlite/usage) docs for more detail on querying.

## Migrating to val-scoped sqlite

There is currently no built-in way to migrate your existing global databases to val-scoped ones (should you want to), but you can do so in userspace relatively easily. E.g. this [copy-sqlite-table](https://www.val.town/x/petermillspaugh/copy-sqlite-table) val contains a generic script to migrate one table from your Val Town account-based (global) database to a val-scoped database.
