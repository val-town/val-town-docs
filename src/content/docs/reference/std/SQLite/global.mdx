description: Account-scoped SQLite databases

Prior to “scoped” SQLite databases for each val, which landed in 2026, every Val Town user account has had its own global SQLite database (since 2023). In most cases, val-scoped databases make more sense, but account-scoped (global) databases will continue to work forever.

## Migrating to val-scoped databases

There is currently no built-in way to migrate your existing global databases to val-scoped ones (should you want to), but you can do so in userspace relatively easily. E.g. this [copy-sqlite-table](https://www.val.town/x/petermillspaugh/copy-sqlite-table) val contains a generic script to migrate one table from your Val Town account-based (global) database to a val-scoped database.
