[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is a lightweight, standard database. Every [val](/vals) comes with its own private SQLite database that is accessible from any of your vals via [`std/sqlite`](https://www.val.town/v/std/sqlite).

In addition to "scoped" SQLite databases per val, every organization and user also has their own global SQLite database: this is now a legacy system, but it will continue to work forever. Val-scoped SQLite databases are the recommended way to interact with SQLite for new vals.

Val Town SQLite is powered by [Turso](https://turso.tech/).
