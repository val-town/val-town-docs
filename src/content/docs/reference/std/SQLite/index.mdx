[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is a lightweight, standard database. Every Val Town account comes with its own private SQLite database that is accessible from any of your vals via [`std/sqlite`](https://www.val.town/v/std/sqlite).

Val Town SQLite is powered by [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

### SQLite Admin Panels

We recommend these admin data viewers for managing your database – viewing or editing data or your database table schema:

- [Outerbase Studio](https://libsqlstudio.com/) **(recommended)** - formerly LibSQL Studio – see [instructions](https://libsqlstudio.com/docs/connect-valtown)
- [SQLite Explorer](https://www.val.town/v/nbbaier/sqliteExplorerApp) – built in a val – easy to customize in Val Town!
