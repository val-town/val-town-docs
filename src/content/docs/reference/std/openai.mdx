description: Integrate with OpenAI's APIs to add AI capabilities to your vals
---

Use OpenAI's chat completion API with [`std/openai`](https://www.val.town/v/std/openai). This integration enables access to OpenAI's language models without needing to acquire API keys.

Val Town free users can use any cheap model – where output is less than $1 per
million tokens – such as `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, and `gpt-4o-mini`. Val
Town Pro users can make 10 expensive requests per rolling 24-hour window, and
are then bumped down to `gpt-5-nano`.

This SDK is powered by
[our openapiproxy](https://www.val.town/x/std/openaiproxy).

## Basic Usage

```ts title="Example" val
import { OpenAI } from "https://esm.town/v/std/openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "Say hello in a creative way" },
  ],
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
  max_tokens: 100,
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

## Images

To send an image to ChatGPT, the easiest way is by converting it to a 
data URL, which is easiest to do with [@stevekrouse/fileToDataURL](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/fileToDataURL).

```ts title="Image Example" val
import { fileToDataURL } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/fileToDataURL";

const dataURL = await fileToDataURL(file);
const response = await chat([
  {
    role: "system",
    content: `You are an nutritionist. 
  Estimate the calories.
  We only need a VERY ROUGH estimate.
  Respond ONLY in a JSON array with values conforming to: {ingredient: string, calories: number}
  `,
  },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: [{
      type: "image_url",
      image_url: {
        url: dataURL,
      },
    }],
  },
], {
  model: "gpt-4o",
  max_tokens: 200,
});
```

## Limits

While our wrapper simplifies the integration of OpenAI, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:

- **Usage Quota**: We limit each user to 10 requests per minute.
- **Features**: Chat completions is the only endpoint available.

If these limits are too low, let us know! You can also get around the limitation by using your own keys:

1. Create your own API key on [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an [environment variable](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables?adding=true) named `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Use the `OpenAI` client from `npm:openai`:

```ts title="Example" val
import { OpenAI } from "npm:openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();
```
