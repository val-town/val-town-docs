description: Store and retrieve binary data with Val Town's blob storage system
---

Val Town comes with blob storage built-in. It allows for storing any data, like text, JSON, or images. You can access it via [`std/blob`](https://www.val.town/v/std/blob).

Blob storage is scoped globally to your account. If you set a blob in one val, you can retrieve it by the same key in another val. It's backed by Cloudflare R2.

### Blob Admin Panels

- [Blob Storage in Settings](https://www.val.town/settings/blob) – built-into Val Town - list, download, delete blobs
- [Blob Admin](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/blob_admin) – search, view, edit, upload blobs – built in a val – easy to customize in Val Town!

### Usage

##### Get JSON

```ts title="Get JSON"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

let blobDemo = await blob.getJSON("myKey");
console.log(blobDemo); // returns `undefined` if not found
```

##### Set JSON

```ts title="Set JSON"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.setJSON("myKey", { hello: "world" });
```

##### List keys

```ts title="List Keys"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

let allKeys = await blob.list();
console.log(allKeys);

const appKeys = await blob.list("app_");
console.log(appKeys); // all keys that begin with `app_`
```

##### Delete by key

```ts title="Delete"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.delete("myKey");
```

### Examples

- [Counter](https://www.val.town/v/std/docsBlobCounterDemo)
- [RSS Notifications](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/rssNotifyExample) (saving the last run time)
- Picture: [Save](https://www.val.town/v/andreterron/blobSavePictureExample) & [Read](https://www.val.town/v/andreterron/blobReadPictureExample)

### Error Handling

- `blob.get` can throw [`ValTownBlobNotFoundError`](https://val.town/v/std/ValTownBlobNotFoundError)
- Any method can throw [`ValTownBlobError`](https://val.town/v/andreterron/ValTownBlobError) for unexpected errors.

### Utilities

Our Blob SDK also includes some utility functions to make working with blobs easier.

##### Copy

```ts title="Copy"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.copy("myKey", "myKeyCopy");
```

##### Move

```ts title="Move"
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.move("myKey", "myKeyNew");
```

### Lower-level API

We provide access to the lower-level getter and setters,
which are useful if you are storing non-JSON or binary data,
need to stream in your response or request data, or do anything else lower-level.

- `async get(key: string)`: Retrieves a blob for a given key.
- `async set(key: string, value: string | BodyInit)`: Sets the blob value for a given key. See [BodyInit](https://deno.land/api@v1.38.1?s=BodyInit).

### Limitations

- Blob-stored data counts towards your total Val Town storage – 10mb on the free plan and 1gb on pro. Check our [pricing page](https://val.town/pricing) to learn more.
- Keys for blobs can be up to 512 characters long.
