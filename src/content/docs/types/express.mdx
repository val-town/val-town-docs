:::caution[Deprecated]

New vals [should use the Web API instead](/types/http), which supports a wider
range of inputs & outputs.

:::

The Express API allows to run a Val as an [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
route handler. The Express system will be familiar to folks who have written web
servers with Node.js, and gives you control over details like response headers
and redirection.

You can return HTML
([example val](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse.expressHTMLExample),
[output](https://api.val.town/v1/express/stevekrouse.expressHTMLExample?name=Townie))
or define a webhook handler to adhere to another service's specifications
([example val](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse.handleOnboardingReferral)).

The Val must be a function. It is passed two arguments, the
Express **[req](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req)** and **[res](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res)** objects.
You can use **`req`** to pull out request data, and **`res`** to respond with
any valid Express response. Learn more at
the [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html).

Unauthenticated use will only be able to call public vals as Express handlers.
The Val will be executed with Val author's permissions, so it will be able to
read and write to author's public and private vals, read their environment variables, and send
them emails via **`console.email`**.

:::note[Not all express methods are included]

For security reasons, the versions of the express Request and
Response objects exposed to vals don't expose all methods. Requests have the
methods: `method` `query` `body` `baseUrl` `params` `secure` `subdomains`
`fresh` `protocol` `path` `originalUrl` `acceptsCharsets` `acceptsEncodings`
`acceptsLanguages` `accepts` and `get`. Responses have the methods `json`
`jsonp` `status` `send` `type` `get` `redirect` `end` `set` .

:::

## `handle-val.express.val.run`

The Express API can be called via GET or POST. You can access the JSON-parsed
POST request body via `req.body`:

```ts title="@user/postWebhook" val
export let postWebhook = (req: express.Request, res: express.Response) => {
  res.json({ data: `Hello + ${req.body.name}!` });
};
```

```ts title="Fetch @user/postWebhook" val
import { fetchJSON } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/fetchJSON";

export let postWebhookTest1 = await fetchJSON(
  "https://user-postWebhook.express.val.run",
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ name: "Steve" }),
  },
);
```

Check out the [ExpressJS docs](http://expressjs.com/) to figure out how to use
the `req` and `res` objects or add `express.Request` and `express.Rsponse` types
to your parameters and you'll see what properties exist on them inline:

## Custom Status Codes

Like any Express server, you can respond with
[custom headers](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.set), and custom status
codes.

```ts title="Example" val
// Visit: https://api.val.town/v1/express/vtdocs.customStatusCode
export const customStatusCode = (req: express.Request, res: express.Response) => {
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418
  res.status(418).send("I'm a teapot");
};
```
