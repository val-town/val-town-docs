Val Town supports asynchronous functions with the basic primitives
of [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
in JavaScript. All kinds of handler vals, including HTTP, Email,
and Interval, can be async functions: if they return a Promise,
we await it.

We also wait until other, non-awaited asynchronous work is done
before exiting from a Val: we wait for the runtime to gracefully
exit after all promises have resolved.

You can use this feature to make an HTTP val that responds quickly
to an incoming HTTP request, and then does some other work
_after_ sending a response.

Here's an example of deferring work using an anonymous
async function. This val responds to HTTP requests
with `{ "ok": true }` immediately, and then waits a second,
and then logs the word "Hi!". You can use the same structure
to schedule time-consuming work like database queries
or network traffic till after the Val's response is already sent.

```ts title="Unawaited async function" val
export async function handle() {
  // Schedule work to do later
  (async () => {
    // Wait 1 second
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    // Log a message
    console.log("Hi!");
  })();
  return Response.json({ ok: true });
}
```

The key to both techniques is that the async work does
_not_ use the `await` keyword, so JavaScript does not wait
for it to finish before returning the Response object.

### waitUntil

This technique is a stopgap until full support for
[waitUntil](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ExtendableEvent/waitUntil)
lands in Val Town, which will handle this case more explicitly.

### Promises should otherwise be awaited

While this is a  useful technique, it's important to emphasize that,
in general, you should otherwise `await` every Promise.
If you don't remember to use `await` with Promises - besides this
narrow usecase, errors that occur in promises won't be properly
handled and functions may run out-of-order.

For example, if you use `fetch` to request some resource,
but forget to await it, then it won't throw errors when it fails,
and you won't have the values you expect to have:

```ts
export async function handle() {
  try {
    // Result will be an opaque Promise, not a useful value.
    const result = fetch('https://google.com/');
  } catch (e) {
    // Errors will never be caught here because
    // fetch is not awaited.
    handleError(e);
  }
}
```
