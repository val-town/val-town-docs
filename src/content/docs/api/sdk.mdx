The Val Town TypeScript SDK lets you interact with our
[REST API](/api) from the comfort of a typed
client that works well with editor autocomplete.

The Val Town SDK runs in:

- Val Town
- Node.js 18 LTS+
- Deno v1.28.0+
- Bun 1.0+
- Cloudflare Workers
- Vercel Edge Runtime

### Getting started in Val Town

The quickest way to get started with the SDK is to use it in
Val Town, for example by [remixing this val](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/demoSDK).

```ts title="Using the SDK in Val Town" val
import ValTown from "npm:@valtown/sdk";

const vt = new ValTown();

// print your email
const me = await vt.me.profile.retrieve();
console.log(me.email);

// list some of your vals
const vals = await vt.me.vals.list({});
console.log(vals);
```

Authentication is set by the `VAL_TOWN_API_KEY` environment
variable, which is automatically set within Val Town. You can control the
API scopes of that key in your val's settings page.

### Getting started in Node.js

Here is how to get started with the SDK,
with Node.js, writing [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).
You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) already
installed, version 18 or newer.
There are _many_ ways to set up JavaScript and TypeScript
projects, and it's likely that you already have a project
you intend to integrate against, so we don't document every
approach.

```bash title="Setting up an example Node.js project"
# Create a directory for your project
mkdir example-project
cd example-project
# Create a package.json file
npm init
# Install the SDK
npm install @valtown/sdk
```

Create a file named `index.mjs`. Note that it needs to end
with `.mjs`, not `.js`, because this file is using ESM import
syntax. Alternatively, you can [add `"type": "module"` to your package.json file.](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#enabling)

```ts title="index.mjs"
import ValTown from "@valtown/sdk";

const valTown = new ValTown();

async function main() {
  const myProfile = await valTown.me.profile.retrieve();
  console.log(myProfile);
}

main();
```

Finally, the API expects to be authenticated with an API
token, so [create an API token on Val Town](https://www.val.town/settings/api), and set it in your
terminal environment:

```bash title="Setting your Val Town API Token"
export VAL_TOWN_API_KEY=your api tokenâ€¦
```

Now you should be able to run `index.mjs` and get your profile
information:

```bash title="Running index.mjs and getting profile information"
node index.mjs
