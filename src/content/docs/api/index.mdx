Val Town's REST API allows you to programmatically manage your account and its resources: vals, blob storage, sqlite databases, likes, comments, and more.

<Aside type="tip">
  Val Town's REST API should not be confused with [HTTP vals](/types/http),
  which are a way for you to create your own custom HTTP endpoints.
