This is a guide to creating a webhook in Val Town.

#### What is a webhook?

A webhook is a way to receive HTTP requests from other services, like GitHub, Stripe, Linear etc. For example, you can create a webhook that listens for new issues created in a GitHub repository, or a webhook that receives payment notifications from Stripe. (TODO - linkify those examples?)

#### Step 1: Sign up to Val Town

[Sign up to Val Town](https://www.val.town/auth/signup). It's free.

#### Step 2: Create an HTTP handler

Or remix?

TODO - explain the connection between HTTP handler/trigger and webhook
