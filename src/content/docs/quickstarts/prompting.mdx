Val Town provides multiple ways to leverage LLMs in your coding workflow:
- [**Townie**](#edit-single-vals-with-townie) for working with individual vals
- [**OpenTownie**](#edit-projects-with-opentownie) for working with multi-file projects 
- [**Your favorite IDE**](#edit-projects-with-your-favorite-ide) (ie. Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, GitHub Copilot) for working with projects locally
- [**Your favorite LLM**](#general-llm-use) with `llms.txt` for any external AI assistant

### Edit Single Vals with Townie
**[Townie ↗](https://val.town/townie)** is a great AI assistant for creating and editing individual vals. 

You can also access Townie by clicking `Edit in Townie` in any val.

### Edit Projects with OpenTownie
**[OpenTownie (Beta) ↗](https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/OpenTownie)** is designed for editing multi-file [Val Town Projects](../../projects/).

### Edit Projects with your Favorite IDE

#### Step 1: Setup 
Use Val Town with your preferred IDE by first cloning your project locally with our [Val Town CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt):

``` bash
# Install CLI
deno install -gAfr jsr:@valtown/vt

# Set API token
export VAL_TOWN_API_KEY=vtwn_replaceThis

# Clone project locally
vt clone my-project

```

#### Step 2: Add Val Town System Prompt
For each IDE, add our [system prompt](https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/OpenTownie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt) as follows:
- **Cursor**: Add to [Project Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai)
- **Windsurf**: Use [`@-mention` command](https://docs.windsurf.com/chat/overview#%40-mentions) 
- **Zed**: Use [`/file` command](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/commands) 
- **GitHub Copilot**: Create [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot) at the project root

### Your favorite LLM
Use our [llms.txt](../../llms.txt) and [llms-full.txt](../../llms-full.txt) with any LLM.  The [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/) provide structured information to help LLMs understand Val Town.

You can also click `Copy page [in markdown]` or `Open in ChatGPT` on the top right of any docs page to chat about our docs with any LLM.

### Troubleshooting
If things go wrong:
- **Broken code?** Visit the "Versions" tab of your val or "History" of your project to revert
- **Complex changes?** Use [branches](../../projects/branches) and [merge](../../projects/pull-requests/) when stable
- **Code doesn't work?** Ask AI to debug the specific errors by copy and pasting, or screenshotting error messages
